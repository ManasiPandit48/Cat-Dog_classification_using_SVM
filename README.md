# Cat-Dog Image Classification with SVM

## Overview

This project focuses on classifying images of dogs and cats using a Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier. The approach involves extracting features from images using a pre-trained VGG16 model and then applying the SVM algorithm to categorize the images.

### Key Components

1. **Feature Extraction**: Uses VGG16 (excluding the top layers) to convert images into feature vectors.
2. **Model Training**: Trains an SVM classifier on the extracted features from the training dataset.
3. **Prediction**: Classifies new images by extracting features and using the trained SVM model to make predictions.
4. **Visualization**: Displays the image along with the predicted class label.

### Workflow

1. Load and preprocess images.
2. Extract features using VGG16.
3. Train the SVM classifier on the features.
4. Predict and visualize results for new images.

### Predictions
